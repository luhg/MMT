/**

 * <p>
 * A sentenceConstructor is the object that, in the processing pipeline,
 * takes care of the creation of the SentenceBuilder object
 * starting from the String to translate.
 * <p>
 * From now on, all processing activities will be performed
 * passing through the SentenceBuilder and namely its editors,
 * keeping track of which transformation were applied.
 * <p>
 * Therefore the usage of the SentenceConstructor marks the
 * passage from the series of transformation that we don't have to remember about
 * to the series of transformation that it's necessary to keep track of
 * in our processing pipeline.
 * <p>
 * In the future, the SentenceConstructor will also implement caching techniques.
